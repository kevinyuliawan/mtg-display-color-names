MTG Display Color Names
=============

Chrome extension that appends the display of colors to color names for associated Magic: The Gathering guilds/shards/wedges.

Turn it on/off by clicking on the extension icon, then clicking on the power button. This requires a refresh of the
current page you're on.

TODO
---
- Add options for enabling/disabling display of certain guilds (e.g. if you already know certain ones and only want to display them for certain ones) (also disable 4-color guilds by default since some have common names)
- Add options for a blacklist/whitelist on websites?
- Add option to display the guild symbol
- Option for customizing font size (to be +/- x from the amount it's currently subtracting from aka 4)
- Add option to only replace the first one on the page? That way it's more of a reminder of what color it is
